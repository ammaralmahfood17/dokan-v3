/**
 * GET /api/health — liveness + dependency probe.
 *
 * Vercel/monitoring needs a single cheap endpoint that answers "is this
 * deployment alive, and are its dependencies reachable?" — a failing uptime
 * check has to point at a CAUSE, not just report a 500. So this returns a
 * per-dependency breakdown rather than one opaque status.
 *
 * Deliberate design choices:
 *   * Only READS. A health check that writes (or purges) turns monitoring into a
 *     load generator and can fail under exactly the conditions it is meant to
 *     detect.
 *   * Unauthenticated, but leaks NOTHING: no table names, no row counts, no
 *     error strings from Supabase, no version info. A public endpoint that
 *     echoes `relation "orders" does not exist` hands an attacker a free map of
 *     the schema. Failures are reported as a bare "down" plus the dependency
 *     name.
 *   * `light=1` does a single trivial query for uptime checkers that only need
 *     liveness and must not add load.
