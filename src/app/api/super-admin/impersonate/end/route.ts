/**
 * POST /api/super-admin/impersonate/end
 *
 * Ends the impersonation for THIS browser — proven by the httpOnly
 * dokan-impersonation marker cookie set at start (2026-09-20 hardening:
 * previously any caller who knew the sessionId could terminate the session
 * AND receive the super admin's live tokens in the response body; the
 * marker is now the sole credential and is invisible to page JS).
 *
 * The admin's own session is restored SERVER-SIDE (setSession writes the
 * auth cookies on this response) — super admin tokens are never returned in
 * a body again. Marks the row ended and writes an audit end entry. The
 * The caller's current auth cookies (the TARGET's session) are never signed out
 * here — that would log the store owner out of their own devices.
 *
 * NO RATE LIMIT HERE, unlike its seven sibling super-admin routes (audit
 * 2026-09-26). Those are token-authenticated and keyed on the admin's user id;
 * this one is bound to a single browser by the httpOnly marker cookie, so the
 * credential IS the throttle — a caller can only ever act on the one
 * impersonation their own browser started, and the id is dead once used. An IP
 * or per-user budget would add a failure mode (a legitimate admin whose retry
 * storm 429s and cannot restore their session) without closing any exposure.
