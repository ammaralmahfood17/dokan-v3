/**
 * Next.js client instrumentation — registers Sentry in the BROWSER.
 *
 * Why this file exists (added 2026-09-26): `@sentry/nextjs` v10 only injects
 * the client SDK through `instrumentation-client.ts`. The project had
 * `sentry.client.config.ts` instead, which the SDK explicitly refuses to read —
 * its own build hook prints:
 *
 *   "It appears you've configured a `sentry.client.config.ts` file. Please
 *    ensure to put this file's content into the `register()` function of a Next.js
 *    instrumentation file instead… You can safely delete the file afterward."
 *
 * (`getClientSentryConfigFile` exists in config/webpack.js, but the v10 client
 * entry point comes from `getInstrumentationClientFile` — the four locations
 * checked there are the only ones honoured.)
 *
 * Consequence before this file: every browser-side error (the majority of real
 * reports — render crashes, hydration mismatches, unhandled rejections) was
 * silently dropped. Server/edge errors were fine: `src/instrumentation.ts`
 * already existed and imports sentry.server/edge.config on the right runtime.
 *
 * This is a copy of the old sentry.client.config.ts, kept verbatim so the PII
 * policy stays identical (sendDefaultPii off, ip_address stripped).
